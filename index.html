                I don't know if any of this will be worth reading, but I'll try my best to make it spicy! I love to
                collect different coffee mugs and just started collected those POP figures. I haven't been able to play
                much, but I have so much fun playing golf, especially with friends or family. I plan on regularly
                streaming through Twitch soon, and want to start a Youtube channel once I have a dedicated space for it,
                but that'll just be on the side of whatever coding job I find myself in. I was in the US Army before
                moving to Sacramento, and although it was all good stuff, I wouldn't change a single thing. So far, I
                love this coding bootcamp, especially the fact that every one is super social.

                I can't stand pizza with pineapple because, let's be real, fruit doesn't belong on pizza. Chipotle is
                that one food that I'm always in the mood for, and may have a slight addiction to coffee. Oh you know
                what, a Mimi's Santa Fe omelette is another thing I'm always in the mood for. Anyway, I'm ultimately
                looking to end up in a place in life where I can wake up and be excited to get to work, while being
                happy while doing. With that in mind, I'm hoping this bootcamp can help me achieve that.

                Music is such a huge part of my life; I don't think there is ever a time I'm not listening to it. In
                terms of genres, anything that isn't country is good with me, but lately I've found myself listening to
                the soundtracks of both Man of Steel and Interstellar. If you haven't watched these movies, I highly
                recommend it. Hans Zimmer does an absolutely amazing job at bringing out these movies' true bueaty and
                turning them into the masterpieces they are.
